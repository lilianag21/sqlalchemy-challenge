# sqlalchemy-challenge

For this challenge I leveraged previous class materials and resources such as Stack Overflow and Xpert Learning assistant. I was able to successfully run part 1 of the assignment, but had issues with part 2. The flask API routes are set up, but are not returning the data properly. I understand the concept of the material and will continue to troubleshoot as I work through more assignments like this.
